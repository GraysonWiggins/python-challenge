## Project Description
This Python-Challenge repository contains two projects: PyBank and PyPoll. 

- **PyBank** analyzes financial data to calculate key metrics such as total months, total profits, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits. The results are saved in the PyBankAnalysis.txt file.

- **PyPoll** analyzes election data to determine the total number of votes cast, list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. The results are saved in the PyPollAnalysis.txt file.
